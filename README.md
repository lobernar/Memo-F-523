Implementation of the classical B-tree, B^epsilon-tree and B^delta-tree for my master thesis at Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles (ULB)

## Tree representation
To graphically represent the trees I use the DOT language and compile the result to an svg file. This operation requires the 'graphviz' library.
